# STAR WARS API

This is a fun vanilla JS project.

- `API Practice` — This Project is 100% vanilla JS (lots of code) based. The API is fetched each time the user selects any `option`.
- `Advanced Array Manipulation with Sort and Filters` — Basic and fun implementation of `High-Order Functions` of JS.
- `DOM Manipulation Practice` — Creating New Element, Removing Elements, adding and removing classes and much more. 

This was a fun project, took quite a long to finish but the feeling is AWESOME.
